\description{
This dataset, china_io_2007_135_df, is a data frame that represents the national input-output table
of China for the year 2007. It covers 135 economic sectors and provides inter-sectoral flows of goods
and services. Data values are measured in 10,000 Chinese Yuan (CNY) and calculated at producers' prices.
}
\details{
The dataset name has been kept as 'china_io_2007_135_df' to avoid confusion with other datasets
in the R ecosystem. This naming convention helps distinguish this dataset as part of the
ChinAPIs package and assists users in identifying its specific characteristics.
The suffix 'df' indicates that the dataset is a base R data frame. The original content has not been modified
in any way.
