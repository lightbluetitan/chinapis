Title: Access Chinese Data via Public APIs and Curated Datasets
Version: 0.1.0
Maintainer: Renzo Caceres Rossi <arenzocaceresrossi@gmail.com>
Description: Provides functions to access data from public RESTful APIs including 'Nager.Date', 
    'World Bank API', and 'REST Countries API', retrieving real-time or historical data 
    related to China, such as holidays, economic indicators, and international demographic 
    and geopolitical indicators. Additionally, the package includes one of the largest 
    curated collections of open datasets focused on China and Hong Kong, covering topics 
    such as air quality, demographics, input-output tables, epidemiology, political 
    structure, names, and social indicators. The package supports reproducible research 
    and teaching by integrating reliable international APIs and structured datasets from 
    public, academic, and government sources.
